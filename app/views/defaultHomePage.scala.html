            <p>Keep an eye on your vehicle's engine health by tracking its fuel economy. Every time you refuel make a note of how many miles you have driven from last refuel, and how much you had to put in.</p>
            <p>You could use just pen and paper or an Excel spreadsheet or go fancy and enter the details of each refuel here. You'll get fancy-schmancy graphs and whatnot to visualise your average fuel consumption and track fuel prices and all sorts of stuff.</p>
            <p>I personally just decided to go use this simple domain to tinker with Scala and the latest Play framework, and doobie, cats, cats-effect, oauth, etc.</p>
