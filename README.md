Fuel Meter
===

Keep an eye on your vehicle's engine health by tracking its fuel economy. Every time you refuel make a note of how many miles you have driven from last refuel, and how much you had to put in.

You could use just pen and paper or an Excel spreadsheet or go fancy and enter the details of each refuel here. You'll get fancy-schmancy graphs and whatnot to visualise your average fuel consumption and track fuel prices and all sorts of stuff.

I personally just decided to go use this simple domain to tinker with Scala and the latest Play framework, and doobie, cats, cats-effect, oauth, etc.
